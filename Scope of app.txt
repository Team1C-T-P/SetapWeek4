Scope of app

what attributes do people want
how would we give them incentive to walk

- do you use anything while walking?
- if you did, how would you want it to be set up?
- do you walk a lot?
- do you respond well to incentivised environments?
- is there any app currently that meets your purposes (limits, likes and dislikes of app)?
- What makes you like that app?
- what makes you stop using it?
- what could keep you more engaged?
- What would you like to look after? (avatar - animal plant etc.)
- How long would you walk for?
- Any goals that you would want to meet?
- Any specific route/general walking/errands?
- You use your phone while walking? How much? (how likely would they go on our app while walking)
- Do you have goals to walk more?
-do you have a pet?

extra from group discussion:
too much content can be overwhelming
how would this be useful for people who already walk alot? (hiking?)
